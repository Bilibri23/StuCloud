## 1. Introduction  

Student housing has become one of the most urgent challenges on the African continent. It is directly linked to academic performance, financial stability, and student well-being. With rapidly growing enrollment in universities, accommodation facilities have failed to keep pace.  

- **Hostels** are overcrowded and deteriorating.  
- **Private rentals** are expensive and often poorly regulated.  
- **Students** are forced into unstable and unsafe ad-hoc arrangements.  

**StuCloud** is a distributed, cloud-based system designed to tackle this challenge. Unlike simple rental applications that just display listings, StuCloud emphasizes **affordability, roommate compatibility, and collaboration**. Students not only find housing but also:  

- Match with compatible roommates.  
- Share contracts, receipts, and bills.  
- Collaborate in managing their shared living.  

Technically, StuCloud is built as a **distributed systems simulation** with a **Virtual Controller** managing multiple **Nodes** (students, landlords, or housing offices). Housing data and roommate profiles are **replicated** across nodes for **fault tolerance and availability**, while **cloud computing principles** allow the service to scale elastically as more users join.

## 2. Problem Description  

### 2.1 Housing Crisis in African Universities  

African universities have doubled or tripled their enrollments in the past 20 years, yet student accommodation supply has stagnated.  

- **Nigeria:** Estimated demand of **1.8 million beds**; supply is fewer than **500,000**.  
- **Cameroon:** Overcrowding is common, with **6â€“8 students sharing a room built for 2**.  
- **Kenya:** Students in Nairobi commute long distances because nearby housing is insufficient.  
- **South Africa:** Despite significant investment, student protests highlight persistent housing shortages.  

### 2.2 Pain Points Experienced by Students  

1. **Affordability**  
   Renting alone is almost impossible for low-income students. Many need roommates to share costs.  

2. **Fragmented Information**  
   Housing opportunities are advertised via posters, word of mouth, or scattered WhatsApp groups.  

3. **Roommate Problems**  
   Students lack structured systems for finding compatible roommates, leading to conflict, instability, and even violence.  

4. **Unreliable Infrastructure**  
   Frequent blackouts and poor connectivity cause loss of data and disrupt access to housing information.  

5. **Scams**  
   Fake landlords exploit desperate students by demanding deposits for non-existent houses.  

### 2.3 Socio-Economic Impact  

- **Academic decline:** Students perform poorly or drop out due to unstable living conditions.  
- **Financial stress:** Families struggle with rising rents.  
- **Community impact:** Informal, unsafe housing contributes to crime and poor health.  

---

## 3. Problem Scope  

StuCloud directly addresses **student housing around African universities**, focusing on:  

- Students seeking affordable rooms.  
- Landlords posting available housing.  
- Roommate matching for shared costs.  
- Collaboration in managing shared housing.  
- Distributed design for scalability and fault tolerance.  

**Boundaries:**  
- StuCloud does not solve the national housing crisis.  
- Focus is limited to **university towns**.  
- Starts as a **simulation project**, with potential for real-world deployment.  

---

## 4. Solution Proposal  

StuCloud provides a **scalable, fault-tolerant, and collaborative housing platform**.  

**Key Features:**  
- **Marketplace:** Central hub for listings.  
- **Roommate Matching:** Profiles (budget, lifestyle, location, habits) used to suggest compatible roommates.  
- **Collaboration Tools:** Groups share rental contracts, bills, and documents.  
- **Distributed Architecture:** Controller + nodes with replication.  
- **Cloud Deployment:** Elastic scaling to handle peak semester demand.  

---

## 5. System Design  

### 5.1 Architecture  

- **Virtual Controller (Server):** Coordinates nodes, replication, matching, and monitoring.  
- **Nodes:** Represent students, landlords, or campus offices.  
- **Replication Service:** Ensures redundancy of files and listings.  
- **Matching Module:** Suggests roommates using preference-based scoring.  
- **Collaboration Workspace:** Real-time sharing of housing documents.  
- **API Layer:** REST/gRPC for dashboard integration.  

### 5.2 Data Flow  

1. Landlord (Node A) uploads a listing.  
2. Controller replicates it across Nodes B, C, and D.  
3. Student (Node E) searches listings â†’ consistent results from replicas.  
4. Student uploads roommate profile â†’ controller suggests candidates.  
5. Matched students form a group â†’ collaborate through shared workspace.  

### 5.3 Distributed Features  

- **Segmentation:** Large files (contracts, IDs) split into chunks before replication.  
- **Threading:** Multiple uploads/downloads processed concurrently.  
- **Fault Tolerance:** Data remains accessible despite node failures.  
- **Scalability:** New nodes (universities/campuses) join seamlessly.  

---

## 6. How Distributed Systems Help  

- **Replication:** Prevents loss of housing data.  
- **Partition Tolerance:** Service remains functional even during network disruptions.  
- **Scalability:** Supports thousands of students across multiple campuses.  
- **Collaboration:** Students share resources in real-time.  

---

## 7. How Cloud Computing Helps  

- **Elasticity:** Handles spikes in housing demand at semester start.  
- **IaaS:** Virtual servers for controller/nodes.  
- **PaaS:** Platform for API and services.  
- **SaaS:** StuCloud as a student housing service.  
- **Deployment Models:**  
  - **Private cloud** for a single university.  
  - **Public cloud** for multiple universities.  
  - **Hybrid** (local + cloud backup).  

---

## 8. CAP Theorem in StuCloud  

StuCloud applies the **CAP theorem trade-off**:  

- **Consistency (C):** Eventual. Listings may take time to sync across replicas.  
- **Availability (A):** High priority. Students must always access listings.  
- **Partition Tolerance (P):** Maintained during outages.  

**Trade-off:** StuCloud chooses **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)** over strict consistency, since slight delays are acceptable compared to downtime.  

---

## 9. Proposed Technologies  

- **Backend Communication:** gRPC for controller-node messaging.  
- **Languages:** Java (Spring Boot) or Python (FastAPI).  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL.  
- **Storage:** Local FS (for simulation) â†’ extendable to AWS S3.  
- **Frontend:** React dashboard.  
- **Deployment:** Docker containers, later Kubernetes.  
- **Version Control:** GitHub repo.

## 11. Expected Results  

- Affordable student housing through shared rentals.  
- Reliable access to listings and roommate profiles.  
- Fault-tolerant, distributed housing storage.  
- Scalable platform covering multiple campuses.  
- Digital collaboration for students managing shared housing.

## 12. Conclusion  

StuCloud tackles the **real-world African problem of unaffordable student housing and lack of structured roommate matching**. Unlike solutions that only display listings, StuCloud enables affordability through roommate compatibility and collaboration.  

By applying **distributed systems concepts** (replication, scalability, fault tolerance) and **cloud computing** (elasticity, SaaS models, hybrid deployments), StuCloud creates a **resilient, scalable, and collaborative platform**.  

StuCloud demonstrates how technology can **reduce costs, stabilize student communities, and strengthen academic success** â€” an African problem solved with distributed systems and cloud computing.
