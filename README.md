## 1. Introduction  

Student housing has become one of the most urgent challenges on the African continent. It is directly linked to academic performance, financial stability, and student well-being. With rapidly growing enrollment in universities, accommodation facilities have failed to keep pace.  

- **Student Hostels** are overcrowded, chooked up and deteriorating.  
- **Private rentals** are expensive and often poorly regulated.  
- **Students** are forced into unstable and unsafe ad-hoc arrangements.  

**StuCloud** is a distributed, cloud-based system designed to tackle this challenge. Unlike simple rental applications that just display listings, StuCloud emphasizes **affordability, roommate compatibility, and collaboration**. Students not only find housing but also:  

- Match with compatible roommates.  
- Share contracts, receipts, and bills.  
- Collaborate in managing their shared living.  

Technically, StuCloud is built as a **distributed systems simulation** with a **Virtual Controller** managing multiple **Nodes** (students, landlords, or housing offices). Housing data and roommate profiles are **replicated** across nodes for **fault tolerance and availability**, while **cloud computing principles** allow the service to scale elastically as more users join.

## 2. Problem Description  

### 2.1 Housing Crisis in African Universities  

Statitics shows African universities have doubled or tripled their enrollments in the past 20 years, yet accomodation of students supply has stagnated.  

- **Nigeria:** Statistics shows estimated demand of **1.8 million beds**; supply is fewer than **500,000**.  
- **Cameroon:** Overcrowding is common, with **6‚Äì8 students sharing a room built for 2**.  
- **Kenya:** Students in Nairobi commute long distances because nearby housing is insufficient.  
- **South Africa:** Despite significant investment, student protests highlight persistent housing shortages.  

### 2.2 Pain Points Experienced by Students  

1. **Affordability**  
   Renting alone is almost impossible for low-income students. Many need roommates to share costs.  

2. **Fragmented Information**  
   Housing opportunities are advertised via posters, word of mouth, or scattered WhatsApp groups.  

3. **Roommate Problems**  
   Students lack structured systems for finding compatible roommates, leading to conflict, instability, and even violence.  

4. **Unreliable Infrastructure**  
   Frequent blackouts and poor connectivity cause loss of data and disrupt access to housing information.  

5. **Scams**  
   Fake landlords exploit desperate students by demanding deposits for non-existent houses.  

### 2.3 Socio-Economic Impact  

- **Academic decline:** Students perform poorly or drop out due to unstable living conditions.  
- **Financial stress:** Families struggle with rising rents.  
- **Community impact:** Informal, unsafe housing contributes to crime and poor health.  

---

## 3. Problem Scope  

StuCloud directly addresses **student housing around African universities**, focusing on:  

- Students seeking affordable rooms.  
- Landlords posting available housing.  
- Roommate matching for shared costs.  
- Collaboration in managing shared housing.  
- Distributed design for scalability and fault tolerance.  

**Boundaries:**  
- StuCloud does not solve the national housing crisis.  
- Focus is limited to **university towns**.  
- Starts as a **simulation project**, with potential for real-world deployment.  

---

## 4. Solution Proposal  

StuCloud provides a **scalable, fault-tolerant, and collaborative housing platform**.  

**Key Features:**  
- **Marketplace:** Central hub for listings.  
- **Roommate Matching:** Profiles (budget, lifestyle, location, habits) used to suggest compatible roommates.  
- **Collaboration Tools:** Groups share rental contracts, bills, and documents.  
- **Distributed Architecture:** Controller + nodes with replication.  
- **Cloud Deployment:** Elastic scaling to handle peak semester demand.

## 5. System Design
 System Diagrams will be provided later, placeholders inserted as replacement
The architecture of StuCloud is intentionally modeled as a distributed system with a central **Virtual Controller** and multiple **Nodes** representing students, landlords, and university housing offices. The design prioritizes **scalability, fault tolerance, and collaboration**, which are essental requirements of distributed systems and cloud computing.  

### 5.1 High-Level Architecture  

The architecture can be visualized in three main layers:  

1. **Controller Layer (Virtual Controller)**  
   - Acts as the central coordinator.  
   - Manages node registration, communication, replication, and consistency.  
   - Logs activities (e.g., node connected, file uploaded, roommate matched).  

2. **Node Layer**  
   - Represents individual entities:  
     - **Student Nodes** ‚Üí search housing, create roommate profiles, upload contracts.  
     - **Landlord Nodes** ‚Üí upload listings, documents, rental details.  
     - **University Housing Nodes** ‚Üí act as trusted verification bodies.  
   - Each node maintains local state and communicates with the controller.  

3. **Collaboration & API Layer**  
   - Handles file sharing, roommate group collaboration, notifications.  
   - Provides REST/gRPC APIs for integration with web dashboards or mobile apps.

### 5.3 Distributed Features  

- **Segmentation:** Large files (contracts, IDs) split into chunks before replication.  
- **Threading:** Multiple uploads/downloads processed concurrently.  
- **Fault Tolerance:** Data remains accessible despite node failures.  
- **Scalability:** New nodes (universities/campuses) join seamlessly.

## 6. How Distributed Systems Help  

Distributed systems are at the core of StuCloud, ensuring that the platform is not only functional but also resilient, scalable, and collaborative. Instead of relying on a single server, the system distributes workload and data across multiple nodes, which makes it more tolerant to failures and better suited for Africa‚Äôs infrastructural challenges.

### 6.1 Replication for Reliability

Replication ensures that critical housing and roommate data is always available, even if some nodes fail.

**Fault Tolerance**: When a node storing listings goes offline, other replicas can still serve the data.

**Load Sharing**: Queries (like ‚Äúfind me a room under $50‚Äù) can be distributed among nodes to prevent overload.

Practical Example: If Node A (University Server in Yaound√©) fails, Node B (University Server in Douala) still has the same listings and roommate profiles.

### 6.2 Partition Tolerance for Unreliable Networks

African regions often face power cuts, poor internet, or weak mobile data. Partition tolerance ensures StuCloud continues to serve requests even when nodes cannot talk to each other.

Users on disconnected nodes can still read cached data (listings, roommate profiles).

Updates are synchronized later when the connection is restored.

This avoids frustrating downtime for students relying on time-sensitive housing searches.

### 6.3 Scalability for Growing Demand

StuCloud is designed to grow with universities.

**Horizontal Scaling**: New student or landlord nodes can be added without major redesign.

**Elastic Scaling**: Cloud resources expand or contract based on demand (e.g., during semester starts).

**Database Sharding**: Data can be divided by city or university to improve performance.

For example, ICT University may start with 5,000 users. If demand grows to 50,000 across several universities, StuCloud can simply provision new nodes and balance traffic automatically.

### 6.4 Collaboration via Distributed Workflows

Collaboration is central to the system and is enabled by distributed features:

**Shared Workspace**: Roommates upload and view contracts, receipts, and bills in real-time.

**Notifications**: Events like ‚Äúnew roommate found‚Äù or ‚Äúlandlord approved‚Äù are propagated across all nodes. W can use the pub-sub pattern to achieve this

**Community Monitoring**: Students can collectively flag scams, and these warnings are distributed system-wide.

### 6.5 Performance Optimization

**Load Balancing**: Queries are routed to the least busy replica.

**Caching**: Popular listings (like ‚Äú2-bedroom apartments near ICT campus‚Äù) are cached for fast retrieval.

**Parallelism**: Multiple file uploads/downloads happen simultaneously.

This means that even if thousands of students search at once, StuCloud remains responsive.

### 6.6 Security and Trust in Distributed Systems

Distributed systems help combat fraudulent landlords and unsafe listings.

**Redundant Encrypted Storag**e: Even if one node is hacked, data remains safe.

**University Verification Nodes**: Universities act as trusted validators of listings.

**Distributed Logs**: Every listing and roommate match is logged across multiple nodes, making tampering nearly impossible.

### 6.7 Real-World Analogies

**Google Docs**: Real-time editing ‚Üí mirrors StuCloud‚Äôs roommate collaboration.

**WhatsApp Groups**: Messages replicated globally ‚Üí similar to StuCloud‚Äôs notifications.

### 6.8 Summary

Distributed systems make StuCloud:

Reliable through replication.

Resilient through partition tolerance.

Scalable through elastic growth.

Collaborative through shared resources and workflows.

Without distributed systems, StuCloud would collapse under Africa‚Äôs infrastructural challenges. With them, it becomes a fault-tolerant, scalable, and community-driven platform for solving the real problem of student housing.

## 7. How Cloud Computing Helps  

While distributed systems provide the foundation of resilience and scalability, cloud computing gives StuCloud the infrastructure, elasticity, and flexibility needed to deliver services effectively in the African context. By leveraging cloud technologies, StuCloud can ensure that students and landlords access the system anywhere, anytime, without depending on a single physical server.

### 7.1 Elasticity and Resource Scaling

One of the major strengths of cloud computing is elasticity, the ability to scale resources up or down depending on demand.

**Semester Peaks**: At the beginning of a semester, when thousands of students are searching for accommodation, StuCloud can automatically allocate more compute and storage resources.

**Low Demand Periods**: During breaks or holidays, unnecessary resources can be released, reducing operational costs.

**Practical Example**: A housing search engine that can serve 500 students today can scale instantly to serve 5,000 students tomorrow without downtime.

### 7.2 Deployment Models for StuCloud

Different cloud deployment models make the system adaptable to various institutions:

**Private Cloud:**

A single university deploys StuCloud for its students only.

Sensitive student data (IDs, contracts) stays on campus servers.

Best for universities with strong IT departments.

**Public Cloud**:

Multiple universities across different regions share a single StuCloud instance.

Cheaper and more accessible to smaller institutions.

Encourages collaboration between universities.

**Hybrid Cloud**:

Combines private and public cloud.

Example: University keeps sensitive student data in its private servers, but uses public cloud to store general listings.

### 7.3 Cloud Service Models Applied

StuCloud incorporates all three major cloud service models:

**IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):**

Virtual machines and storage provided by AWS, Azure, or GCP host the controller and nodes.

Reduces the need for universities to purchase physical servers.

**PaaS (Platform as a Service):**

Frameworks for running APIs, roommate matching services, and housing analytics.

Speeds up development and reduces maintenance overhead.

**SaaS (Software as a Service):**

StuCloud is delivered to end users (students, landlords, housing offices) as a web or mobile app.

Students access listings and collaborate without needing to install complex software.

### 7.4 Collaboration Through Cloud Platforms

Cloud computing makes collaboration more powerful:

**Shared Workspaces**: Students in different towns can jointly manage rent payments, contracts, or bills.

**Real-Time Synchronization:** Updates to housing listings are reflected instantly across all devices.

**File Sharing and Storage**: Documents (IDs, contracts, receipts) are uploaded once and securely accessed by multiple parties.

**Notifications**: Cloud-based messaging ensures students are alerted to new housing opportunities immediately.

### 7.5 Fault Tolerance and High Availability in the Cloud

Cloud infrastructure ensures that StuCloud is resilient to failures.

**Multi-Zone Deployment**: If a server in Nairobi goes down, another in Lagos automatically takes over.

**Redundant Storage**: Files are stored in multiple locations (e.g., AWS S3 replication across regions).

**Disaster Recovery**: Backups in cloud storage mean student data is safe even after catastrophic failures.

This is particularly vital in Africa, where power and internet outages are frequent.

### 7.6 Security Benefits of Cloud Computing

Security is critical when handling sensitive student data. Cloud computing strengthens StuCloud in several ways:

**Data Encryption**: All housing data is encrypted during transmission and at rest.

**Identity Management**: Cloud services like AWS Cognito or Firebase Authentication verify students and landlords.

**Access Control:** Only verified users can view or upload listings.

**Audit Logs:** All actions (uploads, roommate matches, landlord approvals) are recorded in distributed logs.

### 7.7 Cost Efficiency and Accessibility

Cloud computing allows pay-as-you-go pricing, which fits the African educational context where budgets are limited.

Universities don‚Äôt need to buy costly hardware.

Small institutions can subscribe only for what they use.

StuCloud remains accessible even on low-end mobile devices through lightweight cloud-based APIs.

### 7.8 Real-World Inspiration

**Google Drive**: Demonstrates file replication and collaboration, similar to StuCloud‚Äôs roommate workspaces.

**Zoom/Teams**: Show how cloud platforms support distributed collaboration in real-time.


### 7.9 Summary

Cloud computing empowers StuCloud to:

Scale elastically during housing demand surges.

Remain resilient to failures through redundancy.

Enable seamless collaboration across regions.

Provide strong security and cost efficiency.

Together with distributed systems, cloud computing ensures that StuCloud is not only a simulation project but also a real-world-ready platform capable of transforming student housing in Africa.

## 8. CAP Theorem in StuCloud  

The CAP theorem is a fundamental principle in distributed systems. It states that in the presence of a network partition, a distributed system can only guarantee two out of three: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

StuCloud is designed with Africa‚Äôs unreliable infrastructure in mind, and therefore prioritizes Availability and Partition Tolerance (AP) over strict Consistency.

### 8.1 Consistency

Definition: All nodes should see the same data at the same time.

StuCloud Approach: StuCloud uses eventual consistency. For example, if a landlord uploads a listing in Yaound√©, it may take a short delay before it appears on nodes in Douala or Nairobi.

Reason: This delay is acceptable because students care more about system availability than instant synchronization.

### 8.2 Availability

Definition: Every request should always receive a valid response.

StuCloud Approach: Even during partial system failures, StuCloud ensures that students can still:

View cached listings.

Access roommate profiles.

Perform local file uploads (synced later).

Example: If a replication node goes offline, students still get responses from remaining active nodes.

### 8.3 Partition Tolerance

Definition: The system continues to function despite communication breakdowns between nodes.

StuCloud Approach: Nodes are designed to work offline and synchronize later.

Example: If internet outages occur in one campus, students can still use cached data and upload files. Once connectivity is restored, the system synchronizes data with other campuses.

### 8.4 Trade-Off Justification

StuCloud chooses AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance):

Why not CA? Strict consistency with availability is impossible under frequent African outages.

Why not CP? Sacrificing availability would frustrate students when they need urgent housing data.

Why AP? It ensures resilience, even if data takes a few minutes to synchronize.
